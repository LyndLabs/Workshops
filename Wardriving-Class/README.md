# Wardriving Class
This folder contains sample code & Jupyter Notebook files for our wardriving data analysis workshop!

## Tools
We use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run the Jupyter Notebook files.  
This is a Python environment that makes data visualization easy with `Pandas` and `Folium`!

#### Challenges:
|#|Name|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|Basic Map Annotations|Learn to create & annotate a basic map in Folium.|
|2|Map Insecure WiFi Networks|Create a simple map of insecure WiFi networks!|
|3|Profiling Device & Networks|Learn to use MAC Address lookup tools & regex to profile potentially vulnerable networks / vendors.|
|4|[CreepDetector](https://github.com/AlexLynd/CreepDetector)|Use Wardriving to detect stalkers!  This example tracks MAC addresses that are spotted across multiple locations.|
|5|Foxhunting|Use a combination of OSINT & WiFi recon to track down the owner of a lost phone!|
